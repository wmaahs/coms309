This program randomly generates a 80x21 map, with mountains around the boarder, and a random arrangement
of roads ('#'), mountains('%'), tress('^'), long grass(':'), and two buildings('M', 'P') in the middle. To run this
program there is a makefile that will compile the executable for you via "make pokemon_map_gen". This will generate the
executable that will generate the map named "./pokemon_map_gen".

This function randomly generates the amount of each object there will be, as well as a random width, height, and
starting location for each object. Each of the different types of terrain have a different range of random values to
offer more variety. After the 2D array of characters is generated for the map, it is printed out to the terminal. The
pokecenter ('P) and the pokemart('M') are place on the road depending on the direction the road is going, if the road is
moving east <-> west, it is placed below the road. If the road is moving (north <-> south) then the building is placed
to the right of the road. There are lots of "magic numbers" in this program that were added at the end to make the map
generations look "good" more consistently. Sometime the roads would be very close the boarder which would make the map
ugly, etc.
