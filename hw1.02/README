The poke_world_gen.c along with the pokemon_map_gen.c programs generate a 
401x401 array of pointers to maps called the pokeverse. The main function 
initializes the pokeverse, with all of the pointers initially pointing ot NULL.
The first map is created at the center of the array, where a function called
nav_pokeverse allows users to input commands to navigate around the map.

There is currently a bug in this program where for some reason the western edge is at -199,
and when you try to approach that edge you get a segmentation fault. The same thing occurs on the 
eastern edge but the northern and southern boarders behave exactly as expected. I was trying to debug
this but I couldn't even locate how the segmentation fault was happening because it seemed like the
segmentation fault was happening before I could even do my regular border check.

When I am flying to -200 0, I get a segmentation fault, but if I fly to -201 0, I hit the bounds
checker as expected.

When I am flying to -199 199, and then I try to walk west, I get a segmentation fault.

When I am flying to -199 199, and then I try to walk north, I hit the boarder check, and get
no segmentation fault.

I can't really comprehend how this is happening. I have checked everything that I can think of. I have left comments in my code "BUG" where I think the error is happening but idk.

Everything else works perfectly.

I have bandaided the problem so that the World is still 401 x 401, but there are 199 maps the west and 201 maps to the east, from the center of the world.
