When the program is run with a single command line argument from one of the 9 options (pokemon, moves, pokemon moves, pokemon species, experience,
type names, pokemon stats, stats or pokemon types), it will not initialize curses, instead it will parse the specified csv filename from the database.
The database is located in one of two places. The first location is the /share/coms327/ directory. If the querry for the database in the first location failes,
it will then look for the database in the $HOME/.poke327/ directory. My $HOME env_variable resolves as /home/wmaahs, but the program uses the getenv() function
to resolve this dynamically.

When printing my csv files to std out, I used two spaces after each comma because I have bad eyes and this helped me see the spaces a little easier.
