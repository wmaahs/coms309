The updated game now includs pokemon! At the start of the game, the user is asked to pick one starter pokemon from three randomly generated options.
Once the game has started, when the PC is running around there is 10% of encountering a wild pokemon while running through the tall grass.

When trainers are created, they now are given at least one pokemon to start. There is a 60% chance that the trainer gets a second pokemon,
and then another 60% chance that the trainer is spawned in with 3 pokemon etc. When you battle a trainer, you can no see all of the pokemon in their roster,
as well as some of their pokemons general stats.

The Pokemon class is responsible for most of the work done to generate pokemon. All of the initial generation is done directly in the constructor when the pokemon
is created. There is also a levelup method for the Pokemon class that updates the pokemons stats if the pokemon is higher than level 1.

To my knowledge, everything in my program functions according to the assignment specifications.
