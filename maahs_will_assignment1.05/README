This application uses ncurses to implement a user interface for the pokemon game instead of the timer that we were using previously.
When a PC runs into a NPC, a battle is started, if you hit 'w', you will win. Once the trainer has been defeated,
they apear back on the map after their next turn. All of the other menu options are listed in the window.

All of the requirements for this assignment were met.

I was trying to make a fancy looking table to display the list of trainers, but unfortunatly I ran out of time.
