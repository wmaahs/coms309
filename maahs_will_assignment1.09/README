You are now able to battle wild pokemon as well as trainers. When you are battling wild pokemon, if you throw a pokeball at it and you don't have a full roster, than the pokemon is
automatically added to your roster. You also have a 33% chance of being able to flee from wild pokemon, but every attempt will cost you a turn.

Revives and potions of three different rarities have been added to the PCs bag at the beggining of the game. Commom rarity will heal you 10 HP, Rare rarity will heal you 15 HP, and
Ultra rarity will heal you 20 HP.

A trainer battle is only over once one all of the pokemon belonging to one of the trainers have fainted. If all your pokemon have fainted, you can go to a pokecenter and all of your
Pokemon will be restored to full HP. If you go to a PokeMart, all of your supplies will automatically be refilled.

Good Luck! I know you can become the very best!
